## Localization

All localizations are hosted on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/localmaterialnotes).

### Improve an already existing localization

Logged in with your Crowdin account, open the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/localmaterialnotes), select the language you want to improve and use the "Join" button.

### Add a new language

Create an [issue](https://github.com/maelchiotti/LocalMaterialNotes/issues) mentioning which language you would like to be added.

## External imports scripts

To submit a script that converts an export from an other application to the format used by Material Notes, either open an issue and provide the script, or open a pull request that add your script to the [external_imports](docs/external_imports) directory (in that case, please name the file after the application).
